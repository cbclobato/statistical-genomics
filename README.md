# Statistical Genomics

This repository contains the Laboratory Exercises and Final Project performed for the Statistical Genomics course held in the frame of my PhD at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz).


## Description

The course provides knowledge of high throughput array and sequencing technologies and hands-on experience with the analysis of the data from various applications. Examples of applications are transcriptome sequencing (microarrays and RNA-seq), variant calling, and ChIP-seq.


**Lab 1** Fundamentals of Molecular Biology and working with Unix systems
**Lab 2** Data wrangling and visualization with R
**Lab 3** Gene expression analysis with microarrays
**Lab 4** Next-generation sequencing technologies
**Lab 5** RNA-seq
**Lab 6** ChIP-seq
**Lab 7** ATAC-seq
**Lab 8** MeDIP-seq
**Lab 9** Hi-C
**Lab 10** Genetic variation: SNPs and INDELs
**Lab 11** Genetic variation: Structural and copy number variation
**Final Project**
